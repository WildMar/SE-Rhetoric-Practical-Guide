    <h1>Rhetoric in the Software Engineering Community</h1>
    <div class="intro">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This community uses so much rhetoric and in various ways that one might
        not think it to be rhetorical - coding itself is a language and a way of
        communicating. Between person and machine, but also to past and future
        engineers that may perceive that code. There are also peer review
        systems that happen daily called Pull Requests. These are snippets of
        code that show a difference between what was before and what changes were
        made by the author. One form of communication that one may not consider is
        chat such as Slack or Microsoft Teams, etc. In this article, I will explain
        each of these rhetorical genres, and why rhetoric is important for the
        engineering community as a whole.</p>

            The product of software engineers is the code that produces the software you
            may use day-to-day. Software can be written in a multitude of languages such
            as Python, Java, C, and many more to count. The code is compiled,
            interpreted, and the result is either a bug in the code (resulting in errors
            ) or a successful build of their end product. However, within code itself
            software engineers communicate similar to how one may communicate to another
            reader of the same book you are reading - texts in the margins, quotes,
            comments, etc.

          <h4>Tone</h4>
          <p>
            The tone of code is purely logical and informative. There may be elements of
            humor, but generally code authors maintain a level of professionalism.
          </p>

          <h4>Style</h4>
          <p>
            Although a block of code may not look like typical English as it lacks typical
            sentence structure, each codebase has a sense of style.

            Code is structured in various ways, and is dependent on the language, library or
            even the team that contributes to it. New engineers will find that most
            code-bases have specific style requirements, such as using tabs versus spaces,
            adding a new-line after each function definition, and even the way they name
            variables (using camelCase vs snake_case, etc). Luckily, there are
            “code linters” which are tools that, when run, automatically apply these
            styling rules which are outlined in a configuration file. This way code reviews
            aren’t spent nitpicking over the code style (assuming the linter runs at
            build-time and does not need to be run manually... Otherwise you may get a
            sternly written change-denial message).

            The core elements of code include things such as variables, functions, loops,
            and comments. Comments within code are the most helpful form of rhetoric amongst
            software engineers as comments are a way to inform future code authors. They are
            used to indicate purpose, as is usually done under a function definition, shown
            in the following example.
