      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This community uses so much rhetoric and in various ways that one might
        not think it to be rhetorical - coding itself is a language and a way of
        communicating. Between person and machine, but also to past and future
        engineers that may perceive that code. There are also peer review
        systems that happen daily called Pull Requests. These are snippets of
        code that show a difference between what was before and what changes were
        made by the author. One form of communication that one may not consider is
        chat such as Slack or Microsoft Teams, etc. In this article, I will explain
        each of these rhetorical genres, and why rhetoric is important for the
        engineering community as a whole.</p>

            The product of software engineers is the code that produces the software you
            may use day-to-day. Software can be written in a multitude of languages such
            as Python, Java, C, and many more to count. The code is compiled,
            interpreted, and the result is either a bug in the code (resulting in errors
            ) or a successful build of their end product. However, within code itself
            software engineers communicate similar to how one may communicate to another
            reader of the same book you are reading - texts in the margins, quotes,
            comments, etc.

          <h4>Tone</h4>
          <p>
            The tone of code is purely logical and informative. There may be elements of
            humor, but generally code authors maintain a level of professionalism.
          </p>

          <h4>Style</h4>
          <p>
            Although a block of code may not look like typical English as it lacks typical
            sentence structure, each codebase has a sense of style.

            Code is structured in various ways, and is dependent on the language, library or
            even the team that contributes to it. New engineers will find that most
            code-bases have specific style requirements, such as using tabs versus spaces,
            adding a new-line after each function definition, and even the way they name
            variables (using camelCase vs snake_case, etc). Luckily, there are
            “code linters” which are tools that, when run, automatically apply these
            styling rules which are outlined in a configuration file. This way code reviews
            aren’t spent nitpicking over the code style (assuming the linter runs at
            build-time and does not need to be run manually... Otherwise you may get a
            sternly written change-denial message).

            The core elements of code include things such as variables, functions, loops,
            and comments. Comments within code are the most helpful form of rhetoric amongst
            software engineers as comments are a way to inform future code authors. They are
            used to indicate purpose, as is usually done under a function definition, shown
            in the example to the right.

      <h4>Rhetorical Appeals</h4>

          <p>
            The credibility of the code author is indicated by virtue of the fact that they were able to write code.
            One
            who is
            trained in the art of reading other people's code (and it truly is a skill that takes years to master)
            can
            distinguish a
            seasoned software engineer from a novice programmer. The ways in which this is established is in the way
            they name
            variables, how the functions are structured, and the usefulness of the comments therein.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="appeals-segment">
          <h5 class="appeal-title">Logos</h5>
          <p>Code, in its definition, is logical as computers interpret the code to execute instructions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="appeals-segment">
          <h5 class="appeal-title">Pathos</h5>
          <p>Some may think that there is no representation of pathos within code, and this may be generally true
            for
            raw code.
            However, as previously mentioned there are comments within code, messages to future code authors. In
            professional
            settings, these comments purely serve as informational. However, if you take a look at the open source
            ecosystem you can
            see that it is filled with a diverse pool of code authors. Open source code is littered with comments
            such
            as “I don't
            know why, but this works and I'm afraid to change it” and “only the author and God knew what this code
            does…
            now only
            God knows”. Function names such as “magical_function” and variables such as “dummyVar” also provide a
            hint
            into the mind
            of the code author and their feelings as they drafted a module. Humor, fear, respect, frustration,
            sadness
            are all human
            emotions and each one of these can and are represented within code.

      <div class="peer-review-genre">
        <h3>Peer Review</h3>
        <p>Peer review (also called code review, feedback, etc) is a vehicle for dialog between the code author and
          another person
          who is evaluating the code difference for errors, structure, etc. Similar to how an editor may look over a
          book and comb
          through grammatical errors and the like. This reviewer can be anyone - a member of the team, contributor, a
          mentor, or a
          junior engineer looking to develop their code reading skills.

          The ultimate goal of this review is to ensure no buggy code reaches the end product. An ancillary goal is to
          reinforce
          best practices and clarity, keeping in mind those in the future who may stumble upon a line of code. “Does
          this line of
          code make sense in isolation? Will I have to dig through the entire codebase for context? Is this even
          necessary to this
          task?”.</p>

        </div>


        <h4>Tone</h4>
        Peer review messages are often professional, but the tone is driven by the communication style of the one doing
        the
        review. It can be blunt and concise, or can be filled with gentle language to encourage the code author.
        Style
        As with tone, the style of a Peer review can vary widely depending on the author of the feedback. A senior
        engineer can
        provide in-depth detail on why the code author should change their approach to a line of code, providing
        diagrams and
        links to resources backing up their reasoning. This style normally comes from a principle engineer or team lead,
        who's
        relationship with the code author is one of teacher and student, mentor and mentee.

          <p>
            “Tactless comments have the power to discourage new SEs from asking questions, taking risks, and even
            showing
            their work
            to others. Over time, this has negative consequences for both that novice engineer and shipping code.” -
