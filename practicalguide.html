      <p>This community rhetoric and in various unexpected ways that one might not think it to be rhetorical - code,
        pull requests (also known as merge requests, peer review, etc) and technical documentation. This will explain
        each
        of these rhetorical genres, and why rhetoric is important for the engineering community as a whole.</p>

      <h3>Code</h3>
      <div class="code-genre">
        <div class="text-content-code">
          <p>When one thinks of writing and rhetoric, it isn’t often that code comes to mind. However, coding itself is
            a language and a way of communicating - between person and machine, but also between past and future
            engineers that may perceive that code.
          </p>
          <p>
            The product of software engineers is the code that produces the software you may use day-to-day. Software
            can be written in a multitude of languages such as Python, Java, C, and many more to count. The code is
            compiled, interpreted, and the result is either a bug in the code (resulting in errors) or a successful
            build of their end product. However, within code itself software engineers communicate similar to how one
            may communicate to another reader of the same book you are reading - texts in the margins, quotes, comments,
            etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rhetoricity of code is further supported in a study by Kevin Brock and Ashley Rose Mehlenbacher in which
            they indicate that code comments serve multiple purposes such as explaining how a piece of code functions,
            best practices, and efficiency or elegance of that given code block. Through analyzing this, they state
            “Investigating code comments
            shows us that conventions and values of a development community are constantly instantiated, challenged, and
            negotiated via a variety of rhetorical strategies.” (Brock & Mehlenbacher, 2018)

          <h4>Tone and Style</h4>
          <p>
            The tone of code is purely logical and informative. There may be elements of
            humor, but generally code authors maintain a level of professionalism.
            Although a block of code may not look like typical English as it lacks typical
            sentence structure, each codebase has a sense of style.
          </p>
          <p>
            Code is structured in various ways, and is dependent on the language, library or
            even the team that contributes to it. New engineers will find that most
            code-bases have specific style requirements, such as using tabs versus spaces,
            adding a new-line after each function definition, and even the way they name
            variables (using camelCase vs snake_case, etc). Luckily, there are
            “code linters” which are tools that, when run, automatically apply these
            styling rules which are outlined in a configuration file. This way code reviews
            aren’t spent nitpicking over the code style (assuming the linter runs at
            build-time and does not need to be run manually... Otherwise you may get a
            sternly written change-denial message).
          </p>
          <p>
            The core elements of code include things such as variables, functions, loops,
            and comments. Comments within code are the most helpful form of rhetoric amongst
            software engineers as comments are a way to inform future code authors. They are
            used to indicate purpose, as is usually done under a function definition, shown
            in the example to the right.

          “Rhetorical features of code, we posit, exist within its articulation of components (e.g., through naming of
          variables and functions in code files), through its structure (e.g., by promoting certain procedural logics of
          how to compute data), and through its process of iterative development (e.g., as multiple contributors create
          and edit those files).” - Rhetorical Genres in Code by Kevin Brock and Ashley Rose Mehlenbacher

      <h4>Rhetorical Appeals</h4>
      <div class="appeals-block">
        <div class="appeals-segment">
          <h5 class="appeal-title">Ethos</h5>
          <p>
            One who is trained in the art of reading other people's code (and it truly is a skill that takes years to
            master) can distinguish a seasoned software engineer from a novice programmer.
            The credibility of the code author is indicated by virtue of the fact that they were able to write code.
            The ways in which this is established is in the way they name variables, how the functions are structured,
            and the usefulness of the comments therein.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="appeals-segment">
          <h5 class="appeal-title">Logos</h5>
          <p>Code, in its definition, is logical as computers interpret the code to execute instructions. In fact,
            by virtue of the code working, that indicates a straightforward appeal to logic. The fact that it works
            at all proves that the logic of the code written therein is sound. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="appeals-segment">
          <h5 class="appeal-title">Pathos</h5>
          <p>In professional settings, these comments purely serve as informational, with no room to appeal to emotion.
            However, if you take a look
            at the open source ecosystem you can see that it is filled with a diverse pool of code authors. Open source
            code is littered with comments such as “I don't know why, but this works and I'm afraid to change it” and
            “only the author and God knew what this code does… now only God knows”. Humor, fear, respect, frustration,
            sadness are all human emotions
            and each one of these can and are represented within code.

      <div class="peer-review-genre">
        <h3>Peer Review</h3>
        <p>Peer review (also called code review, feedback, etc) is a vehicle for dialog between the code author and
          another person who is evaluating the code difference for errors, structure, etc. Similar to how an editor may
          look over a book and comb through grammatical errors and the like. This reviewer can be anyone - a member of
          the team, contributor, a mentor, or a junior engineer looking to develop their code reading skills.</p>

        <p>The ultimate goal of this review is to ensure no buggy code reaches the end product. An ancillary goal is to
          reinforce best practices and clarity, keeping in mind those in the future who may stumble upon a line of code.
          One such reviewer may ask themselves: “Does this line of code make sense in isolation? Will I have to dig
          through the entire codebase for context? Is this even necessary to this task?”.</p>

        </div>

        <h4>Tone and Style</h4>
        <p>
          Peer review messages are often professional, but the tone is driven by the communication style of the one
          doing
          the review. It can be blunt and concise, or can be filled with gentle language to encourage the code author.
          As with tone, the style of a Peer review can vary widely depending on the author of the feedback. A senior
          engineer can provide in-depth detail on why the code author should change their approach to a line of code,
          providing diagrams and links to resources backing up their reasoning. This style normally comes from a
          principle
          engineer or team lead, who's relationship with the code author is one of teacher and student, mentor and
          mentee.

            “Tactless comments have the power to discourage new SEs from asking questions, taking risks, and even
            showing their work to others. Over time, this has negative consequences for both that novice engineer and
            shipping code.” - Kristen Foster-Marks, <a

      <h3>Technical Documentation</h3>
      <div class="technical-doc-genre">
        <p>
          This form of rhetoric serves to inform not only engineers but the information therein can be useful to many
          roles across the engineering organization. Product managers, designers, stakeholders and the like can read
          technical documentation to understand the product in more granular detail. Well-written and maintained
          technical documentation can serve as an invaluable resource for current and future engineers. Instead of
          scouring through ancient changelogs in git, deciphering and assuming intended purpose within the lines of
          code, engineers can use technical documentation as a guide map for what has already been explored and
          considered but rejected. Although many roles create their own technical documentation (such as design
          documents, product roadmaps, etc), this article will focus on the types of documentation Written by engineers.

        <p>
          Technical docs can take on many forms:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>RFC (Request for Comment) - although initially created to outline the internet and its protocols, software
            engineers adopt the structure of RFC within their own organizations. These can outline internal systems,
            best practices and other information while maintaining an organized structure recognized across the
            engineering community.</li>
          <li>System Documentation</li>
          <li>Software architecture documentation</li>
          <li>Technical design document</li>
          <li>Api documentation</li>
