      <h2 class="topic-header">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Software engineers as whole communicate constantly and almost exclusively through writing. READMEs,
        tickets, to review comments, technical documentation, and even code are all examples of rhetorical genres.
        Although there are many more rhetorical genres to list, this article will focus solely on the code, and pull
        requests (also known as merge requests, peer review, etc), and why rhetoric is important for the engineering
        community as a whole.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="genre">
      <h2 class="topic-header">Code</h2>
      <div class="code-genre">
        <div class="text-content-code">
          <p>When one thinks of writing and rhetoric, it isn’t often that code comes to mind. However, coding itself is
            a language and a way of communicating - between person and machine, but also between past and future
            engineers that may perceive that code.
          </p>
          <p>
            The product of software engineers is the code that produces the software you may use day-to-day. Software
            can be written in a multitude of languages such as Python, Java, C, and many more to count. The code is
            compiled, interpreted, and the result is either a bug in the code (resulting in errors) or a successful
            build of their end product. However, within code itself software engineers communicate similar to how one
            may communicate to another reader of the same book you are reading - texts in the margins, quotes, comments,
            etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rhetoricity of code is further supported in a study by Kevin Brock and Ashley Rose Mehlenbacher in which
            they indicate that code comments serve multiple purposes such as explaining how a piece of code functions,
            best practices, and efficiency or elegance of that given code block. Through analyzing this, they state
            “Investigating code comments
            shows us that conventions and values of a development community are constantly instantiated, challenged, and
            negotiated via a variety of rhetorical strategies.” (Brock & Mehlenbacher, 2018)

          <h3>Tone and Style</h3>
          <p>
            The tone of code is purely logical and informative. There may be elements of
            humor, but generally code authors maintain a level of professionalism.
            Although a block of code may not look like typical English as it lacks typical
            sentence structure, each codebase has a sense of style.
          </p>
          <p>
            Code is structured in various ways, and is dependent on the language, library or
            even the team that contributes to it. New engineers will find that most
            code-bases have specific style requirements, such as using tabs versus spaces,
            adding a new-line after each function definition, and even the way they name
            variables (using camelCase vs snake_case, etc). Luckily, there are
            “code linters” which are tools that, when run, automatically apply these
            styling rules which are outlined in a configuration file. This way code reviews
            aren’t spent nitpicking over the code style (assuming the linter runs at
            build-time and does not need to be run manually... Otherwise you may get a
            sternly written change-denial message).
          </p>
          <p>
            The core elements of code include things such as variables, functions, loops,
            and comments. Comments within code are the most helpful form of rhetoric amongst
            software engineers as comments are a way to inform future code authors. They are
            used to indicate purpose, as is usually done under a function definition, shown
            in the example to the right.

          “Rhetorical features of code, we posit, exist within its articulation of components (e.g., through naming of
          variables and functions in code files), through its structure (e.g., by promoting certain procedural logics of
          how to compute data), and through its process of iterative development (e.g., as multiple contributors create
          and edit those files).” - Rhetorical Genres in Code by Kevin Brock and Ashley Rose Mehlenbacher

      <h3>Rhetorical Appeals</h3>
      <div class="appeals-block">
        <div class="appeals-segment">
          <h4 class="appeal-title">Ethos</h4>
          <p>
            One who is trained in the art of reading other people's code (and it truly is a skill that takes years to
            master) can distinguish a seasoned software engineer from a novice programmer.
            The credibility of the code author is indicated by virtue of the fact that they were able to write code.
            The ways in which this is established is in the way they name variables, how the functions are structured,
            and the usefulness of the comments therein.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="appeals-segment">
          <h4 class="appeal-title">Logos</h4>
          <p>Code, in its definition, is logical as computers interpret the code to execute instructions. In fact,
            by virtue of the code working, that indicates a straightforward appeal to logic. The fact that it works
            at all proves that the logic of the code written therein is sound. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="appeals-segment">
          <h4 class="appeal-title">Pathos</h4>
          <p>In professional settings, these comments purely serve as informational, with no room to appeal to emotion.
            However, if you take a look
            at the open source ecosystem you can see that it is filled with a diverse pool of code authors. Open source
            code is littered with comments such as “I don't know why, but this works and I'm afraid to change it” and
            “only the author and God knew what this code does… now only God knows”. Humor, fear, respect, frustration,
            sadness are all human emotions
            and each one of these can and are represented within code.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="peer-review-genre">
        <h2 class="topic-header">Peer Review</h2>
        <p>Peer review (also called code review, feedback, etc) is a vehicle for dialog between the code author and
          another person who is evaluating the code difference for errors, structure, etc. Similar to how an editor may
          look over a book and comb through grammatical errors and the like. This reviewer can be anyone - a member of
          the team, contributor, a mentor, or a junior engineer looking to develop their code reading skills.</p>

        <p>The ultimate goal of this review is to ensure no buggy code reaches the end product. An ancillary goal is to
          reinforce best practices and clarity, keeping in mind those in the future who may stumble upon a line of code.
          One such reviewer may ask themselves: “Does this line of code make sense in isolation? Will I have to dig
          through the entire codebase for context? Is this even necessary to this task?”.</p>

        <p>However, as with any form of communication regarding feedback, there is a delicate balance between being an
          efficient communicator and being an effective social communicator. The peer review process lends to many
          opportunities for teaching and mentorship within the community due to its inherent vulnerable nature, but can
          also be an avenue for inhibiting growth. In an article by Kristen Foster-Marks, she states “Tactless comments
          have the power to discourage new SEs from asking questions, taking risks, and even showing their work to
          others. Over time, this has negative consequences for both that novice engineer and shipping code.”

        <h3>Tone and Style</h3>
        <p>
          Peer review messages are often professional, but the tone is driven by the communication style of the one
          doing
          the review. It can be blunt and concise, or can be filled with gentle language to encourage the code author.
          As with tone, the style of a Peer review can vary widely depending on the author of the feedback. A senior
          engineer can provide in-depth detail on why the code author should change their approach to a line of code,
          providing diagrams and links to resources backing up their reasoning. This style normally comes from a
          principle
          engineer or team lead, who's relationship with the code author is one of teacher and student, mentor and
          mentee.

        <div class="appeals-block">
          <div class="appeals-segment">
            <h4 class="appeal-title">Ethos</h4>
            <p> As with code, the credibility of the author is determined by the level of experience and position within
              the team (if this is within a team environment). The author can further demonstrate their level of
              expertise by providing further detail and mentorship within their message.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="appeals-segment">
            <h4 class="appeal-title">Logos</h4>
            <p> The reasoning that the author of the review provides as to why a change should be made or why the given
              change is a good one appeals to logic, further reinforced by whether or not the code runs (because,
              remember, sometimes it <em>only</em> works on your machine!).
            </p>

          </div>
          <div class="appeals-segment">
            <h4 class="appeal-title">Pathos</h4>
            <p> The emotions that peer reviews tend to appeal to are of the persuasive variety. However, as with any
              form of feedback, it is rife with emotion and tension due to the fear of rejection, or even a fear of the
              possibility of having to rewrite everything from scratch because the engineer misinterpreted the task.

      <h2 class="topic-header">Why Rhetoric is Important for Software Engineers</h2>
      <p> Rhetoric is important for Software Engineers to understand because our success relies on effective
        communication. From communicating needs to stakeholders, sharing knowledge among developers in the community, to
        leaving breadcrumbs for future developers who dare tread on legacy code, Software Engineers utilize rhetoric
        throughout their careers. Lack of communication leads to dysfunction within the team and the codebase. When a
        number of engineers (or God forbid the original author of the software) abandon the code, the only thing any
        future engineers can rely on are the written word. Not only is writing and rhetoric important for software
        engineers to do in their day to day, but it’s even more imperative that they understand how to effectively
        communicate using these methods.
